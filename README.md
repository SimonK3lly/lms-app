# Last Man Standing (LMS) - Football Prediction App

## Project Overview

Last Man Standing is a sophisticated React-based web application that demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development technologies and best practices. This project showcases my ability to create a complex, user-friendly application that integrates third-party APIs, implements secure authentication, and manages real-time data.


## The Game
Last Man Standing is an football prediction game usually played between friends or teammates where participants attempt to correctly predict one winning team each week from a selection of matches. If your chosen team wins, you progress to the next week. If they lose or draw, you're eliminated. The last participant standing wins the competition. This app provides a platform for users to join LMS competitions, make predictions, and track their progress throughout the football season.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure login using Firebase, supporting both email/password and Google Sign-In methods.
- **Real-time Data Management**: Utilized Firebase Firestore for efficient, real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **Third-party API Integration**: Seamlessly integrated the Football-Data API to fetch and display live match data.
- **Complex State Management**: Implemented React Context API for global state management, demonstrating understanding of advanced React concepts.
- **Responsive Design**: Created a fully responsive UI that works flawlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Admin Functionality**: Developed an admin panel for competition management, showcasing ability to create role-based access control.

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- Football-Data API
- CSS3 (with Flexbox/Grid for layouts)
- Axios for API requests
- React Router for navigation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Netlify for hosting

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **React**: Extensive use of functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Utilized modern JavaScript features throughout the application.
- **CSS**: Implemented custom styling with a focus on responsiveness and user experience.
- **Firebase**: Leveraged Firebase for authentication and as a backend-as-a-service.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrated ability to work with RESTful APIs and handle asynchronous operations.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration, with implementation of CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Environment Configuration**: Properly managed environment variables for secure deployment.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

- Implemented a clear and scalable project structure.
- Used consistent coding style and naming conventions.
- Prioritized code reusability through custom hooks and utility functions.
- Implemented error handling and data validation throughout the application.

## Deployment

This application is deployed using Netlify. The live version can be viewed at https://lastmanstand.ie/.

## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Future Enhancements

- Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Add more advanced statistics and data visualization for match predictions(betting odds).
- Implement a mobile app version using React Native.

## Development Notes

When running the application locally, it will use cached fixture data from Firestore instead of making live API calls. This is to simplify the local development setup and avoid potential CORS issues. The live API calls will work correctly in the deployed Netlify environment.

Note: Local development will use cached data and may not reflect the most recent fixtures.
