# Last Man Standing (LMS) - Football Prediction App

## Project Overview

Last Man Standing is a sophisticated React-based web application that demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development technologies and best practices. This project showcases my ability to create a complex, user-friendly application that integrates third-party APIs, implements secure authentication, and manages real-time data.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure login using Firebase, supporting both email/password and Google Sign-In methods.
- **Real-time Data Management**: Utilized Firebase Firestore for efficient, real-time data storage and retrieval.
- **Third-party API Integration**: Seamlessly integrated the Football-Data API to fetch and display live match data.
- **Complex State Management**: Implemented React Context API for global state management, demonstrating understanding of advanced React concepts.
- **Responsive Design**: Created a fully responsive UI that works flawlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Admin Functionality**: Developed an admin panel for competition management, showcasing ability to create role-based access control.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **React**: Extensive use of functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Utilized modern JavaScript features throughout the application.
- **CSS**: Implemented custom styling with a focus on responsiveness and user experience.
- **Firebase**: Leveraged Firebase for authentication and as a backend-as-a-service.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrated ability to work with RESTful APIs and handle asynchronous operations.
- **Git & GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration, with implementation of CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
- **Environment Configuration**: Properly managed environment variables for secure deployment.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

- Implemented a clear and scalable project structure.
- Used consistent coding style and naming conventions.
- Prioritized code reusability through custom hooks and utility functions.
- Implemented error handling and data validation throughout the application.

## Deployment

This application is deployed using Firebase Hosting. The live version can be viewed at https://lms-app-2f048.web.app/.
